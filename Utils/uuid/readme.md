# 🏷️uuid
The library provides a function for generating UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) in version 4 format. UUIDs are 128-bit unique identifiers that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as generating unique IDs for database records or as session IDs in web applications. The version 4 UUIDs are generated using random or pseudo-random numbers, and are designed to have a very low probability of collision with other UUIDs.
